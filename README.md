I created a Hangman game using Python. Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where the player must guess the letters in a secret word. 
With Python, I was able to bring this timeless game to life, allowing players to enjoy the challenge of solving words while honing their vocabulary skills.
By developing this Hangman game, I aimed to create a fun and interactive way for players to enjoy a classic pastime while showcasing the power and versatility of the Python programming language.
